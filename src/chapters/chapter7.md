## Building a LUIS App

In this chapter, you'll learn:
- how to build intents
- how to create entities and map them to intent phrases
- how to improve accuracy of LUIS using phrase lists

### Overview

In the last chapter you learned about the basics of LUIS: intents, utterances, entities. You also learned how we'll be using LUIS and how it will integrate into our speech-to-text pipeline.

I don't want to delay us too much, so let's dive right in by creating your first LUIS app.

### Creating a LUIS app

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Creating a LUIS App
</h4>

Log in to the LUIS portal at [https://luis.ai](https://luis.ai), and navigate to the *My Apps* area:

<img src="images/chapter7/luis1.png" class="img-override" />

This page lists the various LUIS apps you have created.

Click the *Create new app* button. Name it *Pokemon*:

<img src="images/chapter7/luis2.png" class="img-override" />

After creating the app, you be redirected to the *Intent* page automatically:

<img src="images/chapter7/luis3.png" class="img-override" />

There's not much more to creating the initial LUIS app, so let's continue on with defining your app intents.

This concludes the exercise.

### Creating Intents

You'll recall that LUIS intents are represent actions the user wants to perform. The intent is a purpose or goal expressed in a user's input, such as booking a flight, paying a bill, or finding a news article. In our case, we'll be creating intents like sitting down, scratching, jumping, etc.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Creating LUIS intents
</h4>

Log in to the LUIS portal at [https://luis.ai](https://luis.ai), and navigate to the *Intents* area by first navigating to the *My Apps* areas, drilling down into the *Pokemon* app:

<img src="images/chapter7/luis3.png" class="img-override" />

This page lists the various intents you have created. You'll notice that a *None* intent was automatically created for you. All LUIS apps start with this intent - you *should not* delete it. The *None* intent is used as a default fall-back intent for your LUIS apps. 

#### Finding the intents

You'll be creating a variety of intents in the *Pokemon* app. To help you, we've already defined the intents for you. In the code you downloaded from Github, locate the *language-understanding-data* folder. It contains a file named *luis-utterances.md*:

<img src="images/chapter7/luis4.png" class="img-override" />

Inside the markdown file, you'll find an intent followed by a series of utterances. For example:

```
# Sit
- ash's best friend should sit down
- sit pikachu
- sit on the floor pikachu
- have a seat meowth
- meowth please sit on the ground
```

In the snippet above, the heading `Sit` is the name of an intent you'll create, followed by utterances that align to the intent.

LUIS is like the Custom Speech Service, as it needs to *learn* the types of phrases (or utterances) that map to an intent. 

Referencing the *luis-utterances.md* file, create intents for each intent listed in the document.

Follow along below to create the first intent, then rinse and repeat for the remaining intents.

#### Adding an intent

To add an intent, click the *Create new intent* button:

<img src="images/chapter7/luis5.png" class="img-override" />

Name the intent *Sit*, as referenced in the *luis-utterances.md* file:

<img src="images/chapter7/luis6.png" class="img-override" />

On the next screen, the *Sit* intent will be listed at the top. In the text box below the intent, enter in the related utterances from the *luis-utterances.md* file. After each utterance, press *Enter* to save the utterance.

<img src="images/chapter7/intent.gif" class="img-override" />

You'll notice that the LUIS portal associated the utterance with the intent each time you press *Enter*.

When you've finished entering the associated utterances, you can scroll down to review and modify them:

<img src="images/chapter7/luis7.png" class="img-override" />

You'll also notice each utterance has a drop down next to it allow you to re-associate it with a different intent, if you made a mistake.

When you're finished entering the utterances for this intent, navigate back to the list of intents by clicking the *Intents* link on the left:

<img src="images/chapter7/luis8.png" class="img-override" />

#### Finish adding the remaining intents

Proceed to add the remaining intents listed in the *luis-utterances.md* file. When you're finished, your list of intents should look like these:

<img src="images/chapter7/luis9.png" class="img-override" />

This concludes the exercise. 

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

### Adding Entities

After adding intents to your LUIS app, it's time to add entities. As you'll recall, an entity represents detailed information that is relevant in an utterance. For example, in the utterance "Jigglypuff, stop singing", "Jigglypuff" is a Pokemon. By recognizing and labeling the entities that are mentioned in the userâ€™s utterance, LUIS helps you choose the specific action to take to answer a user's request.

#### Additional entity information

There are a few important things about entities that are relevant, but we hadn't covered them yet. 

First, entities are optional but highly recommended.

While intents are required, entities are optional. You do not need to create entities for every concept in your app, but only for those required for the app to take action.

For example, as you begin to develop a machine learning pipeline that integrates LUIS, you may not have a need to identify details/entities to act upon. So, when starting off, don't add them. Then, as your app matures, you can slowly add entities. 

Second, entities are shared across intents. They don't belong to any single intent. Intents and entities can be semantically associated but it is not an exclusive relationship. This allows you to have a detail/entity be applicable across various intents. 

In the LUIS app you're building today, we'll be defining a *Pokemon* entity that can identify a Pokemon by name. Because each of our intents typically involves a particular Pokemon, the *Pokemon* entity will be shared across intents. This means that an intent/entity combination gives us a unique action to perform. 

For example, the "Jigglypuff, sing." utterance yields the intent of *Sing* with an identified *Pokemon* entity of type *Jigglypuff*. 

#### Types of entities

LUIS has a variety of entity types, and each has a specific use. There are too many to dive into here, but I encourage you to learn more by reading the [LUIS documentation]()https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-concept-entity-types#types-of-entities.

Now that you know about entities, let's add the *Pokemon* entity.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Creating LUIS intents
</h4>

Log in to the LUIS portal at [https://luis.ai](https://luis.ai), and navigate to the *Entities* area by first navigating to the *My Apps* areas, drilling down into the *Pokemon* app:

<img src="images/chapter7/ent1.png" class="img-override" />

This page lists the entities you have defined.

Click the *Create new entity* button to create the *Pokemon* entity. Select *List* as the entity type:

<img src="images/chapter7/ent2.png" class="img-override" />

> **List Entities**
>
> A list entity is a fixed list of values. Each value is itself a list of synonyms or other forms the value may take. For example, a list entity named PacificStates include the values Washington, Oregon, California. The Washington value then includes both "Washington" and the abbreviation "WA".

After clicking the *Done* button, you're redirected to the *Pokemon* entity detail page. Add the following values:
- Pikachu
- Jigglypuff
- Meowth

After adding these Pokemon, add synonyms for each, as shown below.

<img src="images/chapter7/ent2.png" class="img-override" />

By adding these synonyms, you train LUIS to recognize the synonyms as the entity list value. For example, *bubble pokemon* will be recognized as a *Pokemon* entity, with *Jigglypuff* as the specific type.

#### Validating entity mapping

When you've finished adding the entities and synonyms, refresh your browser.

To validate that the entities are being properly recognized, navigate back to the *Intents* page, then open the detail page for an intent.

You'll notice that text in each utterance is now replaced with a generic intent *Pokemon* block. You can use the *Entities view* toggle switch to see how utterance text maps to an entity:

<img src="images/chapter7/entity.gif" class="img-override" />

This concludes the exercise. 

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

That's it - you've created intents and entities to help train your LUIS model to recognize Pokemon and an action you want the Pokemon to perform. 

In the next chapter, you'll train, test, and publish your LUIS model.
