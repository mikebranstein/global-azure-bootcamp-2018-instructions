## Building a LUIS App

In this chapter, you'll learn:
- how to build intents
- how to create entities and map them to intent phrases
- how to improve accuracy of LUIS using phrase lists

### Overview

In the last chapter you learned about the basics of LUIS: intents, utterances, entities. You also learned how we'll be using LUIS and how it will integrate into our speech-to-text pipeline.

I don't want to delay us too much, so let's dive right in by creating your first LUIS app.

### Creating a LUIS app

    <b>Exercise</b>: Creating a LUIS App
</h4>

Log in to the LUIS portal at [https://luis.ai](https://luis.ai), and navigate to the *My Apps* area:

This page lists the various LUIS apps you have created.

Click the *Create new app* button. Name it *Pokemon*:

After creating the app, you be redirected to the *Intent* page automatically:

There's not much more to creating the initial LUIS app, so let's continue on with defining your app intents.

This concludes the exercise.
